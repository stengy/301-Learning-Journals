# Learning Journal Day 3  

Today started off with a short class/discussion/presentation on conflict resolution.  Something I find rather refreshing about being at Code Fellows is the emotional intelligence in abundance on campus.  Everyone is amazingly open, supportive, comforting, and exudes exceptional teamwork.  It is a great feeling!  

Today for lecture we covered jQuery Events, which left me with quite a bit of unsure feelings.  The initial two days of 301 seemed a little easy breezy and then today it was kind of like a proverbial hammer just fell!  Since we are working with code already completed and our job is to add to it and make it more dynamic and better, the mindframe is quite a bit different from the previous class.  On one hand it is a little helpful because there are already blocks of code that can be reviewed to see how certain functionality with jQuery works, as well you know getting an understanding of what the app is trying to accomplish; yet on the other hand it adds a different type of challenge, though real world, by having to work with code and logic that wasn't inherently yours in the beginning.  

A part that really hung me up today was dealing with a filter.  In the end it was like 4 lines of code, but it was trying to know what  
`$(this)` was referring to and how to grab that value and only populate data associated with only that value.  It was also having to deal with concatenation and knowing what you can't have inside quotes and making sure you **have** what is **needed** in the quotes.  Definitely was some struggles but, it just builds character!
