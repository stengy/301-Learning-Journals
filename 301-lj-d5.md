# Learning Journal Day 5  

Today we went over forms in jquery.  It was a collab lab (see what I did there) where the whole class went through and built the new html page and js that went with the assignment; which was making a form for new blog submissions.  All in all it was a bit of a slow day but very informative.  I'm loving working with new jquery and handlebars.  While it's taking some getting used to it amazes me every day how some aspects can save you time and lines of code, though also in some other ways it makes it slightly more difficult to read.  Though that may be because it's still new.

Sometime cool that I felt I learned today was the use of ternary.  I had seen the character ? used but never knew what it did, and boooya!  That is a really great way to use the logic of a if/else statement but faster.  Most notably for when you have a pretty simple condition.  Yeah that ternary kind of has me jazzed!
