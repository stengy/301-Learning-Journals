# Learning Journal Day 6  
  ### AJAX!!  

  Today we went over AJAX/JSON and the beginning of more into how the web actually works, such as http requests and how they work.  Some of this I was familiar with from my background in IT/Networks.  The instructor said it was going to be more of a lighter lab day and coupled with a bit of confidence from the subject matter being related to what I already have experience in, I kind of went into lab with thought I'd be done in about 30mins.  I mean there was only 4 `TODO` items right?  And one of them was just calling a function.  Even though it did only take 2hours or so there was some syntax issues that I struggled with big time. Also naming convention and having to get comfortable with similar spelling.  It just had me hunting down some one-of errors more than I should.  As well as I didn't do as much planning or much review before I sat down with my partner and had the text editor open and attempting to tackle the `TODO` items.  That's something I need to work on making into a habit or ritual.  

  After lab I went to a SeattleJS meetup being hosted by Avvo.  The most notable person I met there turned out to be a studen at Berkley University that was in town just to visit and attend some meetups, talk about real commitment!  He was interested heavily into AR/VR, much like myself, so we spent some time talking about various articles and latest news revolving around the tech for the devices and what is in the near future horizon.  He showed me a VR compatible webapp he made that was done in ReactJS!  Which only excited me knowing that is the library that will be covered in 401.
