# Learning Journal Day 8  

Today we began going over SQL.  It was a bit more on the under the hood/nuts and bolts type of day.  Went over what is happening more rather than actually writing out code.  Actually the only code we wrote for lab was setting up the environment and getting a dependency installed.  

Much of the lab was writing comments about what we thought the following lines of code were doing.  It was pretty helpful and was a new way of really approaching programming, one that I think is real world applicable, as often you will find yourself having to work with existing code and will need to spend time reading it and understanding what is going on before you sit down yourself and start hacking away.  

Again the day, theory wise, was a bit easier for me than some of the other students from their comments.  Having worked in IT and server management kind of helps.  I don't have tremendous exp. with SQL but I understand the concepts and have worked with databases, and other types of data management such as Active Directory.  Overall it was a pretty good day, not too rough, but just enough to get you thinking.  Which is always a good thing.
