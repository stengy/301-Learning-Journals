# Learning Journal Day 1  

Today was the first day of the 301 class at Code Fellows and I must say I am pretty stoked!  Most of the day consisted of taking care of all the initial introduction info and a short talk about the culture and mission of CF as a school.  Honestly it was pretty close to a class on emotional maturity & intelligence, which is a good thing.  No complaints from me.  

The new instructor seems like he is going to be a good fit for my learning style, and seems like a pretty down to earth friendly guy; which is important when in a teacher-mentor role.  

What I really took away from today's lecture on code was how to start thinking and getting a website to exhibit RWD in CSS.  Which I find pretty cool, to me it's kind of like setting up if/else statements or a while function, but for styling.  I find it pretty nifty and honestly very worthwhile, given in my own experience how much frustration I have had when having to navigate different websites designed specifically for only one type of device.  

Though I rather enjoy typing and like hard coding, I am more and more coming around to rather enjoying dynamic change.
