# Learning Journal Day 10  

Today was a pretty big shift in thinking and how one approaching building out apps.  We went over moving into more functional programming as opposed to how we have been doing it which is more on the imperative side.  Kind of mind blowing.  

I'm still working on wrapping my head around it, but the lab today most definitely helped, as well as my high speed pairing partner (Shout out to Nicu)!  Something else that wasn't really covered but was in the lab for today was the arrow function!  Wow was it confusing at to even attempt to read, but after having it explained to me and reading through the docs, my partner and I would write out the code normally, and then refactor it using the arrow.  This helped quite a bit, as I could piece by piece see how/what is going on when using it, and I love it!  I love how it makes the code look more streamline and clean.  However until one gets used to what it is doing, it can be difficult to read and understand the code.  

Some other things that were covered and used extensively in the lab were using

```
array.map();
array.filter();
array.reduce();
```

I have mentioned it before, but I am very fond of being able to chain together function/methods. For me it can be a bit easier to read and follow logic.  Using the above, it replaces even having to use `forEach();` or for loops.  Being able to iterate through array's applying a function process without having to start hammering away at for loops is a dream.  It will just come down to more exposure and self pushing in using functional programming for me to finally have it fully click.  The wave is here!
