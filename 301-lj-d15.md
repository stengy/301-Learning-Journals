# Learning Journal Day 15  

Today was basically the start of project week since Monday is a holiday and there isn't officially school that day.  In the morning we had a small lecture, though it mainly just covered what the parameters of the final project were, and looked at some other examples of previous 301 class final projects.  After that we were released for a brief lunch until the partner power hour which was by CBRE, with former students of CF and a former instructor.  

After the partner power hour we were released into our project groups to begin planning out our project pitch, domain model, and wire-frames.  Something that was different from the 201 final project, is that my group was really up for taking the planning phase seriously.  We even put the pitch into a formal document, used Google docs to create the wire-frame as well as giffly program to draw up the domain model flow.  It is probably the **most** organized I have ever been in planning out any project of my life.  I really believe it will pay off.  We have a clear idea of what objects we will have to create, what methods will be attached, the flow of how the app will actually work and have a good general idea of how we want the app to *look*.

Needless to say, I am stoked to get this project underway.
