# Learning Journal Day 11  

Today I was absent again **doh**!  

The class covered mainly client-side routing which touches on a subject I am somewhat familiar with again from having spent time working in the IT field as a Jr Network Engineer.  I think having a foundational understanding of how routing, requests, servers, etc works has been decently helpful since week 2 of this course.  

Overall the lab for the day wasn't too difficult, it only took about ~45mins to complete.  It was mostly just adding in routes and hiding/showing certain information, a little refactoring by editing href's and deleting unneeded functions.

I don't have a lot to write about today, though I am looking forward to diving deeper into API's and how to build/use them!  Project week is fast approaching and the nervs are *starting* to build!
